#Designing a Program

## The Problem

The height of a tree is of great interest to many people. For one thing, if a tree is being cut down, knowing its height
tells you how far away safe is. This is very important to those with a nervous disposition. Your problem is to find out
the height of a tree without using a very long ladder, which itself would introduce risk to life and limb. To find the
height of a tree, you’re allowed the help of a friend—preferably a short friend unless you yourself are short, in which
case you need a tall friend. You should assume that the tree you’re measuring is taller than both you and your friend.
Trees that are shorter than you present little risk, unless they’re of the spiky kind.

## The Analysis

Real-world problems are rarely expressed in terms that are directly suitable for programming. Before you consider
writing a line of code, you need to be sure you have a complete understanding of the problem and how it’s going to be
solved. Only then can you estimate how much time and effort will be involved in creating the solution.
The analysis phase involves gaining a full understanding of the problem and determining the logical process for
solving it. Typically this requires a significant amount of work. It involves teasing out any detail in the specification
of the problem that is vague or missing. Only when you fully understand the problem can you begin to express the
solution in a form that’s suitable for programming.

You’re going to determine the height of a tree using some simple geometry and the heights of two people: you
and one other. Let’s start by naming the tall person (you) Lofty and the shorter person (your friend) Shorty. If you’re
vertically challenged, the roles can be reversed. For more accurate results, the tall person should be significantly taller
than the short person. If they are not, the tall person could consider standing on a box.
